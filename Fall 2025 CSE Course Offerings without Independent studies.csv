One known weakness of deep learning models is lack of explainability; generally, knowledge representation models do not suffer from this problem. In this class we will explore the fundamentals of KR&R by examining many different formalisms and automated reasoning procedures. We will then use this basis to discuss the role of KR&R in modern systems: Why are many technology companies investing in knowledge graphs? When should knowledge representation be preferred to machine learning? Can knowledge representation be combined with machine learning when we have some degree of background knowledge regarding our problem? Can machine learning be used to make automated reasoning more efficient? Students will leave this class with a broader perspective of AI.

One known weakness of deep learning models is lack of explainability; generally, knowledge representation models do not suffer from this problem. In this class we will explore the fundamentals of KR&R by examining many different formalisms and automated reasoning procedures. We will then use this basis to discuss the role of KR&R in modern systems: Why are many technology companies investing in knowledge graphs? When should knowledge representation be preferred to machine learning? Can knowledge representation be combined with machine learning when we have some degree of background knowledge regarding our problem? Can machine learning be used to make automated reasoning more efficient? Students will leave this class with a broader perspective of AI and a set of new tools that they can apply to their research. Students will not be given credit for both CSE 398-046 and CSE 498-046.",
